# Laplacian Edge Detection

> January 2022

**Challenge: Part of a school project, use the Laplacian formula in Matlab.**

Part of a school project, in a group of 4, we decided to use the Laplacian formula to make an edge detection script. It allowed to read an image, apply some filters on it and the Laplacian on each pixel to return only edges of this image. Then, we also conducted an analysis of the script execution time regarding to image sizes. All details are in the report (in French) in the corresponding folder of this repository.
